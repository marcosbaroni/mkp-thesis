The multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) is a strongly NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem which can be viewed as a resource allocation problem and
defined as follows:
\vspace{-15pt}
\begin{align*}
    \text{max} ~ & {\mymathstyle \sum_{j=1}^n p_j x_j} \\[3pt]
    \text{s. to} ~ & {\mymathstyle \sum_{j=1}^n w_{ij} x_j \leqslant c_i \quad i \in \{1, \ldots, m\}}\\
   & x_j \in \{0, 1\}, \quad j \in \{1, \ldots, n\}.
\end{align*}

The work address the application of a metaheuristic called
shuffled complex evolution (SCE) to the MKP.
