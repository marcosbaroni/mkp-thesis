The multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) is a strongly NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem which can be viewed as a resource allocation problem and
defined as follows:
\vspace{-15pt}
\begin{align*}
    \text{max} ~ & {\mymathstyle \sum_{j=1}^n p_j x_j} \\[3pt]
    \text{s. to} ~ & {\mymathstyle \sum_{j=1}^n w_{ij} x_j \leqslant c_i \quad i \in \{1, \ldots, m\}}\\
   & x_j \in \{0, 1\}, \quad j \in \{1, \ldots, n\}.
\end{align*}
The problem is a generalization of the well-known knapsack problem (KP) in which
$m = 1$.

This work addresses an hybrid heuristic using an
efficient variable fixing procedure and the SCE metaheuristic as an improvement
proposal for the work in \cite{baroni2015shuffled}.
