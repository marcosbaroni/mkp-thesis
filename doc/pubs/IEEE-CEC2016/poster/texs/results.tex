Two main tests was considered:
(a) using the set of problems defined by Chu and Beasley~\cite{Chu-Beasley-1998}
and (b) a set composed by 11 instances provided by Glover and Kochenberger in
\cite{glover1996critical}.

Columns {\bf n} and {\bf m} indicate the size of each instance,
{\bf time} column shows the average execution time (lower is better),
{\bf quality} column shows the average ratio of the solution found and
the best known solution from literature, variance shown in parentheses.

It can be noticed that \scecore achieved high quality solutions, at least $98.22\%$
of best known solution, spending small amount of processing time.
