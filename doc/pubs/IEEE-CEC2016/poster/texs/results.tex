Two main tests was considered:
(a) using the well-known set of problems defined by Chu and Beasley~\cite{Chu-Beasley-1998}
and (b) a large set of randomly generated instances using uniform distribution.
The number of constraints $m$ varies among $5$, $10$ and $30$, and the number
of variables $n$ varies among $100$, $250$ and $500$.

For the set of random instances all best known solution was found by the solver
SCIP running for at least 10 minutes.
SCIP is an open-source integer programming solver which
implements the branch-and-cut algorithm.
