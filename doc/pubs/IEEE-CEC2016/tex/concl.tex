In this work we addressed the application of the shuffled complex
evolution (SCE) to the multidimensional knapsack problem and investigated its
performance through several computational experiments.

In this paper we addressed the development of a hybrid heuristic for the MKP
implementing a population based algorithm called shuffled complex evolution
for solving the multidimensional knapsack problem assisted by an efficient
variable fixing procedure.

The SCE algorithm, which combines the ideas of a controlled random search with
the concepts of competitive evolution, proved to be able to achieve fast
convergence ratio, finding good quality near optimal solutions, demanding small
amount of computational time.
The application of the core concept for MKP proved to be efficient to reduce
the size of the problems which provided fast execution time yet producing
high quality solutions.

The hybrid heuristic developed is very well suitable if it is necessary
to compute a good solution in a small processing time.
The heuristic could achieved $99.61\%$ on average of quality of the best known solution for
the 270 Chu-Beasley instances and $99.46\%$ on average for the Glover-Kochenberger instances.

Future works include the investigation of different crossing procedures 
and the use of local search in the process of evolving complexes.
Besides we want to investigate the possibility of using the efficiency measure
directly on metaheuristics.
