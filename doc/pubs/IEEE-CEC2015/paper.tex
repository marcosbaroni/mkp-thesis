\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) is a strongly NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem which can be viewed as a resource allocation problem and
defined as follows:

\begin{align*}
  \text{maximize} & \sum_{j=1}^n p_j x_j \\
  \text{subject to} & \sum_{j=1}^n w_{ij} x_j \leqslant c_i \quad i \in \{1, \ldots, m\}\\
   & x_j \in \{0, 1\}, \quad j \in \{1, \ldots, n\}.
\end{align*}

% Define the MKP
The problem can be interpreted as a set of $n$ itens with profits $p_j$
and a set of $m$ resources with capacities $c_i$.
Each item $j$ consumes an amount $w_{ij}$ from each resource $i$, if selected.
The objective is to select a subset of items with maximum total profit,
not exceeding the defined resource capacities.
The decision variable $x_j$ indicates if $j$-th item is selected.

The multidimensional knapsack problem can be applied on budget planning 
scenarios, subset project selections, cutting stock problems, task scheduling,
allocation of processors and databases in distributed computer programs.
The problem is a generalization of the well-known knapsack problem (KP) in which
$m = 1$.

The MKP is a NP-Hard problem significantly harder to solve in practice than the KP.
Despite the existence of a fully polynomial approximation scheme (FPAS) for the KP,
finding a FPAS for the MKP is NP-hard for $m \geqslant 2$~\cite{magazine1984note}.
Due its simple definition but challenging difficulty the MKP is often used to
to verify the efficiency of novel metaheuristics.

%A metaheuristic is a set of concepts that can be used to define heuristic methods
%that can be applied to a wide set of different problems.
%In other words, a metaheuristic can be seen as a general algorithmic framework which can be applied to
%different optimization problems with relatively few modifications to make them adapted to a specific problem.”

In this paper we address the application of a metaheuristic called
shuffled complex evolution (SCE) to the multidimensional knapsack problem.
The SCE is a metaheuristic (~\cite{duan1992effective})
which combines the ideas of a controlled random search with the concepts
of competitive evolution and shuffling.

The reminder of the paper is organized as follows:
Section~\ref{sec:sce} presents the shuffled complex evolution algorithm
and proposes its application on the multidimensional knapsack problem.
Section~\ref{sec:exp} comprises several computational experiments.
In section~\ref{sec:conc} we make our concluding remarks about the experimental
results.

\section{The shuffled complex evolution for the MKP}
\label{sec:sce}

%The SFLA is a metaheuristic to solve discrete and combinatorial problems
%based on the memetics of living beings and recalls the behavior of a
%group of frogs searching for the location that has the maximum amount of available food.
%In the following subsections we present the concepts of SCE and PSO to finally
%present the shuffled frog leaping algorithm.

%\label{sec:sfla-mkp}

The shuffled complex evolution (\cite{duan1992effective}) is a population
based evolutionary optimization algorithm that regards a natural 
evolution happenning simultaneously in independent communities.
The algorithm works with a population partitioned in $N$ complexes, each one
having $M$ individuals.
In the next Subsection the SCE is explained in more details.
In the later Subsection the application of SCE to the multidimensional knapsack
problem is considered.
% In the SCE the population is partitioned into communities (complexes), each of which
% will evolve independently through a number of evolving steps.
% In each evolving step a subset of the complex (subcomplex) is selected as potencial group of
% parents.

%To avoid been trapped in local optimum a new offspring can be occasionally taken
%from a random location of the feasible space and introduced to the complex.

\subsection{The shuffled complex evolution}
In the SCE a population of $N*M$ individuals is randomly taken from the
feasible solution space.
After this initializing the population is sorted by descending order according
to their fitness and the best global solution is identified.
The entire population is then partitioned (suffled) into $N$ complexes,
each containing $M$ individuals.
In this shuffling process the first individual goes to the first complex, the second
individual goes to the second complex, individual $N$ goes to $N$-th complex,
individual $M+1$ goes back to the first complex, etc.

The next step after shuffling the complexes is to evolve each complex through
a given fixed amount of $K'$ steps.
In each step a subcomplex of $P$ individuals is selected from the
complex using a triangular probability distribution, where the $i$-th individual
has a probability $p_i = \frac{2(n+1-i)}{n(n+1)}$ of being selected.
The use of triangular distribution is intended to prioritize individuals with
better fitness, supporting the algorithm convergence rate.

After the selection of the subcomplex, its worst individual is identified to
be replaced by a new generated solution.
This new solution is generated by the crossing of the worst individual and an
other individual with better fitness.
At first the best individual of the subcomplex is considered for the crossing.
If the new solution is not better than the worst one, the best individual
of the complex is considered for a crossing.
If the latter crossing did not result in any improvement, the best individual
of whole population is considered.
Finally, if all the crossing steps couldn't generate a better individual,
the worst individual of subcomplex is replaced by a new random solution taken
from the feasible solution space.
This last step is important to prevent the algorithm becoming trapped in local minima.
Fig.~\ref{fig:flow2} presents the procedure described above in a flowchart diagram.

After evolving all the $N$ complexes the whole population is again
sorted by descending and the process continues until a stop condition is satisfied.
Fig.~\ref{fig:flow1} shows the SCE algorithm in a flowchart diagram.

\subsection{The shuffled complex evolution for the MKP}

As it can be noted in its description the SCE is easly applied to any
optimization problem.
The only steps needed to be specified is (a) the creation of a new random
solution and (b) the crossing procedure of two solutions.
These two procedures are respectively presented by Fig.~\ref{alg:new} and
Fig.~\ref{alg:cross}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \Procedure{New random solution}{}
    \State $v \leftarrow $ shuffle($1, 2, \ldots, n$)
	\State $s \leftarrow \emptyset$ \Comment{empty solution}
    \For{$ i \leftarrow 1:n$ }
	  \State $s \leftarrow s \cup \{v_i\}$ \Comment{adding item}
	  \If{ $s$ is not feasible} \Comment{checking feasibility}
	    \State $s \leftarrow s - \{v_i\}$
      \EndIf
	\EndFor
  \State return $s$
  \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{Generation of a new random solution for the MKP.}
\label{alg:new}
\end{figure}

To construct a new random solution (Fig.~\ref{alg:new}) the items are
at first shuffled in random order and stored in a list (line 2).
A new empty solution is then defined (line 3).
The algorithm iteratively tries to fill the solution's knapsack with 
the an item taken from the list (lines 4-9).
The feasibility of the solution is then checked: if the item insertion let
the solution unfeasible (line 6) its removed from knapsack (line 7).
After trying to place all available items the new solution is returned.

\begin{figure}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \Procedure{Crossing}{$x^w:$ worst individual, $x^b:$ better individual, $c$}
    \State $v \leftarrow $ shuffle($1, 2, \ldots, n$)
    \For{$ i \leftarrow 1:c$ }
	  \State $j \leftarrow v_i$
	  \State $x^w_j \leftarrow x^b_j$ \Comment{ carriage of gene}
	\EndFor
	\If{$s^w$ is not feasible}
	  \State repair $s^w$
	\EndIf
	\State update $s^w$ fitness
  \State return $s^w$
  \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{Crossing procedure used on SCE algorithm.}
\label{alg:cross}
\end{figure}

The crossing procedure (Fig.~\ref{alg:cross}) takes as input the worst
solution taken from the subcomplex $x^w = (x^w_1, x^w_2, \ldots, x^w_n$),
the selected better solution $x_b = (x^b_1, x^b_2, \ldots, x^b_n$),
and the number $c$ of genes that will be carried from the better solution.
The $c$ parameter will control how similar the worst individual will be from the
given better individual
At first the items are shuffled in random order and stored in a list (line 2).
Then $c$ chosen genes are now carried from the better individual to the worst
individual (line 5).
At the end of steps the feasibility of the solution is checked (line 7) and
the solution is repaired if needed.
The repair stage is a greedy that iteratively removes the item that less
decreases the objective function.
Finally the fitness of the generated solution is updated (line 10) and
returned (line 11).

\section{Computational experiments}
\label{sec:exp}

For the computational experiments a batch of tests was driven to find the best
parameters for the problem.
Afterwards two main tests was considered:
(a) using the well-known set of problems defined by Chu and Beasly (\cite{Chu-Beasley-1998})
and (b) a large set of randomly generated instances using uniform distribution.

\subsection{The Chu-Beasly instances}

The set of MKP instances provided by Chu and Beasly was generated using a
procedure suggested by Freville and Plateau~\cite{freville1994efficient}, which
attempts to generate instances hard to solve.
The number of constraints $m$ varies among $5$, $10$ and $30$, and the number
of variables $n$ varies among $100$, $250$ and $500$.

The $w_{ij}$ were integer numbers drawn from the discrete uniform distribution
$U(0, 1000)$.
The capacity coefficient $c_i$ were set using
$b_i = \alpha\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{ij}$ where $\alpha$ is a tightness ratio and
varies among $0.25$, $0.5$ and $0.75$.
For each combination of $(m,n,\alpha)$ parameters, $10$ random problems was generated,
totaling $270$ problems.
The profit $p_j$ of the items were correlated to $w_{ij}$ and generated as follows:
\begin{displaymath}
  p_j = \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{w_{ij}}{m} + 500q_j \qquad j = 1, \ldots, n
\end{displaymath}

\subsection{The set of random instances}

The second set of instances is composed by problems generated using a similar
setup.
The only difference is that the profit $p_j$ is also drawn from a discrete uniform
distribution $U(0, 1000)$.
For each combination of $(m, n, \alpha)$ parameter, $600$ random problems was
generated, totaling $16200$ problems.

% a set of large MKP instances using the procedure suggested by Freville and
% Plateau (1994). The number of constraints m was set to 5, 10 and 30, and the number of
% variables n was set to 100, 250 and 500. Thirty problems were generated for each m-n
% combination, giving a total of 270 problems.

% where q j is a real number drawn from the continuous uniform generator U (0, 1). In
% general, correlated problems are more difficult to solve than uncorrelated problems (Gavish
% and Pirkul (1985), Pirkul (1987)).
