This work proposes a performance improvement
of a state of art dynamic programming algorithm for
solving the multi-objective knapsack problem by using
a multi-dimensional indexing strategy
for handling large amount of intermediate solutions,
especially for high dimensional cases.
Through several computational experiments
the applicability and efficiency of the strategy is shown,
considerably reducing the number of solution comparisons 
executed which resulted in an algorithm speedup up to $2.3$
for bi-dimensional cases and up to
$15.5$ for 3-dimensional cases.
