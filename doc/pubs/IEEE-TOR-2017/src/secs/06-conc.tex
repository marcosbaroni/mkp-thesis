This paper shows
the application of a multi-dimensional indexing structure
for exactly solving the MOKP with a dynamic programming algorithm
and investigating its efficiency.
Through computational experiments we showed that multi-dimensional indexing
is applicable to the problem requiring considerably less solution evaluations,
especially on hard instances,
which resulted in a algorithm speedup $2.3$ for bi-dimensional
cases and up to $15.5$ on 3-dimensional cases.
The multi-dimensional indexing was not efficient on instances for which the set of solutions
is relatively small.
%Unfortunately there was a discrepancy in execution times between our
%implementation and one reported on the original proposal paper which cause could not
%be discovered.

A promising line of future research is to investigate the performance
of multi-dimensional indexing on heuristic and approximate approaches
for the MOKP as well as others multi-objective problems
with the same requirement of handling a high number of multi-dimensional
intermediary states.
