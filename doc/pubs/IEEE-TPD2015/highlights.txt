We propose a formal model for the non-technical losses reduction problem.
Two new variations of the Knapsack Problem are presented.
We propose three different computational approaches to solve the problem.
We present a set of benchmark instances used to compare the approaches.
An exact approach obtains the best results on the benchmark instances.
