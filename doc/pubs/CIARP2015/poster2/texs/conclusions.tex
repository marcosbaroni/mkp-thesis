In this work we addressed the application of the shuffled complex
evolution (SCE) to the multidimensional knapsack problem and investigated it
performance through several computational experiments.

The SCE algorithm, which combines the ideas of a controlled random search with
the concepts of competitive evolution proved to be very effective in finding
good solution for hard instances of MKP, demanding a very small amount of
processing time to reach high quality solutions for MKP.
