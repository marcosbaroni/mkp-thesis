For the computational experiments a batch of tests was driven to find the best
parameters for the problem.
Afterwards two main tests was considered:
(a) using the well-known set of problems defined by Chu and Beasley (\cite{Chu-Beasley-1998})
and (b) a large set of randomly generated instances using uniform distribution.

\subsection{The Chu-Beasley instances}

The set of MKP instances provided by Chu and Beasley was generated using a
procedure suggested by Freville and Plateau~\cite{freville1994efficient}, which
attempts to generate instances hard to solve.
The number of constraints $m$ varies among $5$, $10$ and $30$, and the number
of variables $n$ varies among $100$, $250$ and $500$.

The $w_{ij}$ were integer numbers drawn from the discrete uniform distribution
$U(0, 1000)$.
The capacity coefficient $c_i$ were set using
$b_i = \alpha\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{ij}$ where $\alpha$ is a tightness ratio and
varies among $0.25$, $0.5$ and $0.75$.
For each combination of $(m,n,\alpha)$ parameters, $10$ random problems was generated,
totaling $270$ problems.
The profit $p_j$ of the items were correlated to $w_{ij}$ and generated as follows:
\begin{displaymath}
  p_j = \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{w_{ij}}{m} + 500q_j \qquad j = 1, \ldots, n
\end{displaymath}

\subsection{The set of random instances}

The second set of instances is composed by problems generated using a similar
setup.
The only differences is that the profit $p_j$ is also drawn from a discrete uniform
distribution $U(0, 1000)$.
For each combination of $(m, n, \alpha)$ parameter, $600$ random problems was
generated, totaling $16200$ problems.

\subsection{Experimental results}

All the experiments was run on a Intel$^R$ Core i5-3570 CPU @3.40GHz computer
with 4GB of RAM.
The SCE algorithm for MKP was implemented in C programming language.
For the set of random instance all best known solution was found by the solver
SCIP 3.0.1 running for at least 10 minutes.

After a previous test batch parameters for SCE was defined as shown in
Table~\ref{tab:params} and used in all executions of SCE.

  \label{tab:params}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:chu} shows the performance of the SCE on the Chu-Beasley set of instance.
Each instance in the set was executed 10 times on SCE.
The \textit{SCE t} column shows the average execution time of SCE algorithm.
The \textit{gap} column shows the average ratio of the solution found by SCE and
the best known solution of each instance.
It can be observed that the SCE has a fast convergence speed, achieving high
quality solutions in few seconds.

\end{figure}

The fast convergence speed of SCE for MKP can be noticed in Fig.~\ref{fig:iter}.
The figure shows for each iterations step, the quality of best solution found
for the first $100$ iterations.
The problem instance used was taken from the second set of problem (random instances).
The best known solution was found with $600$s of execution on SCIP solver and
the execution of the SCE algorithm expended $1.1$ seconds.
