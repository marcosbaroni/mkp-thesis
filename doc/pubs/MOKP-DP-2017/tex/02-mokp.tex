% Breve definicao de multiobjective opt
A general multiobjective optimization problem can be described as a vector
function $f$ that maps a tuple of $n$ parameters (decision variables) to a tuple
of $\np$ objectives.
Formally:
\begin{align*}
  \text{min/max} ~ \sol{y} &= f(\sol{x}) = 
    \big(f_1(\sol{x})
    ,f_2(\sol{x})
    ,\ldots
    ,f_{\np}(\sol{x})\big) \\
  \text{subject to} ~ \sol{x} & = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \in X
\end{align*}
where $\sol{x}$ is called the \emph{decision vector} or \emph{solution}, $X$ denotes the set
of feasible solutions, and $\sol{y}$ is the \emph{objective vector} or \emph{criterion vector} where
each objective has to be minimized (or maximized).

Considering two decision vectors $\sol{a}, \sol{b} \in X$, $a$ is said to
\emph{dominate} $b$ if, and only if:
\begin{align*}
    \forall i &\in \{1, 2, \ldots, \np\}: f_i(\sol{a}) \geq f_i(\sol{b}) \\
    \exists j &\in \{1, 2, \ldots, \np\}: f_j(\sol{a}) > f_j(\sol{b})
\end{align*}

A solution $\sol{a} \in X$ is called \emph{efficient} or \emph{non-dominated}
if there is not other feasible solution $\sol{b} \in X$ such that $\sol{b}$ dominates $\sol{a}$.
The set of solutions of a multiobjective optimization problem consists of all efficient solutions.
This set is known as \emph{Pareto optimal}.

The instance of a multiobjective knapsack problem with $\np$
objectives consists of an integer capacity $W > 0$ and $n$ items.
Each item $i$ has a positive weight $w^i$ and $\np$ non negative integer
profits $p_{i}^{1}, \ldots, p_{i}^{\np}$.
A solution is represented by a vector $\sol{x} = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ of binary
decision variables $x_i$, such that $x_i = 1$ if item $i$ is included in the
solution and $0$ otherwise, satisfing the capacity of the knapsack.
For any instance of the problem, we aim at determining the set of efficient solutions.

Formally the definition of the problem is:
\begin{align*}
    \text{max   } & f(\sol{x}) = 
      \big(f_1(\sol{x}) ,f_2(\sol{x}) ,\ldots ,f_{\np}(\sol{x})\big) \\
    \text{subject to   } & w(\sol{x}) < W \\
    & x_{i} \in \{0, 1\} \quad i = 1, \ldots, n \\
    \text{where} \phantom{mmmmm} \\
    f_j(\sol{x}) &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} v^j_i x_i \quad j = 1, \ldots, \np \\
    w(\sol{x}) &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i
\end{align*}

The MOKP is considered a \nphard{} problem, since it is a generalization
of the well-known 0$-$1 knapsack problem and
it is quite difficult to determine the Pareto optimal set for the MOKP,
especially for high dimension instances, in which the Pareto set it self tends
to grow exponentially.
For this reason, the development of methods efficiently deal with high-dimension
instances is...
