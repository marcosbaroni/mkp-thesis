The core concept was first presented for the well-known 0-1 knapsack problem (KP),
leading to very successful KP algorithms.
The main idea is to reduce the original problem by only considering a core of
items for which it is hard to decide if they will occur in an optimal solution
or not, whereas the variables for all items outside the core are fixed to certain values.
