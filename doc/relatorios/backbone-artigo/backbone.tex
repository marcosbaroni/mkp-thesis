\begin{abstract}
This article contains a draft...as a backbone for an article over the
computational investigation of the hardness the Multidimensional Knapsack
Problem (MKP) as well as the on performance of algorithms for the solution of
instances.

\section{Introduction}

% Definição do problema e aplicações
The 0-1 Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) is a generalization of the Knapsack
Problem where an item expends more than a single resource type.
A MKP having $n$ itens and $m$ dimensions can be defined as follows.

\begin{align*}
  \text{maximize} & \sum_{j=1}^n p_j x_j \\
  \text{subject to} & \sum_{j=1}^n c_{ij} x_j, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m, \\
   & x_j \in {0, 1}, \quad j = 1, \ldots, n.
\end{align*}

The problem can be applied on budget planning scenarios, subset project
selections, cutting stock problems, task scheduling and allocation of processors
and databases in distributed computer programs.
The special case where $m = 1$ is called Knapsack Problem (KP).
Several contributions have been made addressing exact, heuristics, approximation
and probabilistics approaches for the problem.

Due its simple definition, wide application and challenging
difficulty, the MKP turned a quite addressed problem for experiments
with metaheuristics in recent years.
Although none of those have exhibit competitive performance compared to
comercial MIP solvers, at least over the instances existent on literature.
