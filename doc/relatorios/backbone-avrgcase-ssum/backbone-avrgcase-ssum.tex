\title{The expected time on backtrack}
\author{Marcos Daniel Baroni}

% 1: Introduction (and Motivation)
%    - Empirical observation of fast extact solving for major instances of KP;
%    - Motivate research on, respectively: Partition, SSum, KP and MKP;
%    - Existent probabilistic analysis for Partition/SSum, KP and MKP;
%    - Similar work on exact methods for others combinatorial problems;
%      - Cite "some linear behavior on backtrack algorithms has been observed
%        for KP, althougth it seems to be hard to prove."
%      - \ref{datri1982probabilistic}: Probabilistic analysis of the subset-sum problem
%      - \ref{martello1984worst}: Worst-case analysis of greedy algorithms for the subset-sum problem
%      - \ref{lai1993worst}: Worst-case analysis of greedy algorithms for the unbounded knapsack, subset-sum and partition problems
% 2: The backtrack algorithm (Branch-and-Bound)
%    - Justify the use of backtrack, and not Dyn. Prog.:
%      - Possibility of few but high orders items;
%      - Transformation of ohter NP-Complete probs to produce high orders itens;
%      - Scaling of rational coeficients yields high order integer coefficients;
%    - Main (not to say, only) exact approach for exact solution for
%      combinatorial problems;
%    - Possible approaches with Relaxation (LP) and Cuts.
% 3: The Analysis and Research Questions
%    - Expected behavior of backtrack algorithm on Partition problems:
%    - Expected number of solutions for the problem;
%    - Probability of i-th item integrate solution
%      - Need to fix a variable, because of simetry?
