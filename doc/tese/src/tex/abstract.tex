 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
Many real applications like project selection, capital budgeting and cutting stock involves optimizing multiple objectives that are usually conflicting and can be modelled as a multi-objective knapsack problem (MOKP).
Unlike the single-objective case, the MOKP is considered a NP-Hard problem with
considerable intractability.
This work propose a hybrid heuristic for the MOKP based on the
shuffled complex evolution algorithm.
A multi-dimensional indexing strategy for handling large amount of intermediate
solutions are proposed as an optimization, which yields considerable
efficiency, especially on cases with more than two objectives.
A series of computational experiments show the applicability of the proposal
to several types of instances.
