Several combinatorial problems involve the simultaneous optimization of multiple criteria, which are generally conflicting with each other.
These problems are called multiobjective and
do not have a single solution, but a set of solutions of interest.
This work proposes the acceleration of the resolution process of the multiobjective knapsack problem,
through the use of a *kdtree* as a multidimensional index structure to assist the manipulation of solutions.
